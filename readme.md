# Velodrome Sugar üç≠

Sugar comes with contracts to help working with Velodrome Finance data!

## How come?!

The idea is pretty simple, instead of relying on our API for a structured
data set of liquidity pairs data, these contracts can be called in an
efficient way to directly fetch the same data off-chain.

What normally would require:
  1. fetching the number of liquidity pairs
  2. querying every pair address at it's index
  3. querying pair tokens data
  4. querying gauge addresses and reward rate

Takes a single call with _sugar_!

More importantly, the response can be paginated.

Main goals of this little project are:
  * to maximize the developers UX of working with our protocol
  * simplify complexity
  * document and test everything

## But how?

On-chain data is organized for transaction cost and efficiency. We think
we can hide a lot of the complexity by leveraging `structs` to present the data
and normalize it based on it's relevancy.

## Usage

The list of _sugar_ contracts will be published on docs.velodrome.finance

## Development

To setup the environment, build the Docker image first:
```sh
docker build ./ -t velodrome/sugar
```

Next start the container with existing environment variables:
```sh
docker run --env-file=env.example --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app -it velodrome/sugar sh
```

The environment has Brownie and Vyper already installed.

To run the tests inside the container, use:
```sh
brownie test --network=optimism-test
```
